ðŸ‘‰ This project is a part of Nanodegree of Udacity. I will follow the principle of CRISP-DM to create a pipeline for the data science project.

# CRISP-DM

## 1. Business Understanding

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ As an GISer, I will pay attention to the spatial distribution of listings and its connection.

</aside>

- Where has the highest/lowest prize for a list, and what is the reason of such distribution.
- How well can we predict a listâ€™s review score? What aspects correlate well to list satisfaction?

## 2. Data Understanding

Let me introduce the data first. We have two datasets *listings* and *neighbourhoods.* Datasets include the details of Aribnb hosts information in **Shanghai, CHINA.**

We can divide our dataset into four parts.

- **Hosts information**
    - Includes host personal information, hosts name, listings count, superhost and so on.
- **Location**
    - Latitudes and longitudes of each lists (WGS84).
    - Neighbourhood information
- **Room property**
    - Room availability, amenities, type...
- **Review scores**
    - Six dimensions - *accruacy, cleanliness, checkin, communication, location, and value.*
    - Rating - Integrate review score.

## 3. Prepare Data

We will remove redundant information and working with categorical and missing data in this part.

- **Remove redundant information**
    - Only information related with our business understanding questions are kept with.
    - Big fields such as the review detail by customers are removed.
- **Categorical data**
    - We used one-hot coding to code categorical data.
- **Missing data**
    - For the problem1, we will have about 28125 non-missing data because price and location information are the basic information of a list.
    - For the problem2, we just collect about 17000 non-missing data because some customers wonâ€™t give any review score. We will treat those data as *no score* instead of simply deleting because we want to find why they werenâ€™t give the score.

## 4. Model Data

We implemented two kinds of model for our business problem:

- **Spatial analysis**
    - Spatial auto-correlation and Hot spot analysis.
- **Supervised regression**
    - Powerful machine learning methods help us predicting the review score.
    - We will implement Linear Regression (LR), SVM, RF, etc. Comparing its performance and trying to explain it.

## 5. Results

- We will give answers for our business understanding.
- Some useful advices will also be our results due to our findings.

## 6. Deploy

- A jupyter notebook contains all the data processing procedure we have made in this project.
- A solution blog for our findings.
- A GitHub repository for all related files.
